# How does Machine Learning fit into Agricultural Economics Research?




Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the biggest topics in tech right now, and the excitement is spilling over to economics. The 2018 ASSA meetings (I did not attend, just browsed the [program](https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/files/6336.pdf)). had at least five devoted sessions to the topic of machine learning. Susan Athey, economics' favorite AI rockstar, and Guido Imbens (certainly also qualifies as a rockstar) held a wildly popular continuing education workshop at the meetings that was later released as a [webcast](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2018-webcasts).
